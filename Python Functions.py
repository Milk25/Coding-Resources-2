#Â Exercise 1: 

'''
In the digital age, usernames are crucial for identity on various platforms.
Your task is to write a program that checks if
a username is neither too short not too long,
adhering to specific length criteria.

**Instructions**:

1. Prompt the user to entera username.
2. Check if the username is between 5 and 15 character long.
3. If the username meets the criteria, print a confirmation message.
4. If it does not meet the criteria, print a message indicating the username length requirements.
5. Provide the user with the option to try a different username or exit the program.

'''


while True:
username = input("Enter your desired username:")

if 5 <= len(username) <= 15:
    print("Username is valid!")
else:
    print("Username must be between 5 and 15 characters!")

continue_input = input("Do you want to try another username?(yes/no)").lower()
if continue_input != 'yes':

# Exercise 2: The Precise Price Tagger

In retail applications, both online and in-store, 
displaying prices in a clear and precise manner is 
essential for customer satisfaction.
Your task is to write a program that takes 
a price as input and rounds it to two decimal 
places, making it more user_friendly.

**Instructions**:

1. Prompt the user to enter a price.
2. Use the 'round()' function to round the price to two decimal places.
3. Display the rounded price in a format that is easy for customers to understand.
4. Provide the user with the option to enter a new price or exit the program.

'''

while True:
    price_input = float(input("Enter the price: "))
    rounded_price = round(price_input, 2)
    print(f"Rounded Price: $(rounded_price)")

    new_price = input("Would you like to enter in a new price?(yes/no)").lower()
    if new_price != 'yes':
        break

**Problem Statement**:

You are creating a feature for a travel app that allows users to view the temperature in both Celsius
and Fahrenheit, so they can easily understand the weather forecast
no matter where they travel.


**Instructions**:

1. Create a list of temperatures in Celsius that you want to convert.
2. Loop through the list, and for each temperature in Celsius, convert it to Fahrenheit.end=
3. Print out both the Celsius and fahrenheit temperature using f-strings for formatted output.

'''

celsius_temperatures = [10, 20, 25, 30, 35]

for celsius in celsius_temperatures:
    fahrenheit = (celsius + 9/5) + 32
    print(f"{celsius} C is equivalent to {fahrenheit} F")
